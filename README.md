# 🌱 Sustainability & Emissions Analysis (Using MS-EXCEL) 
### **Net Zero 2050 Data Analysis Project**

This project focuses on analyzing operational emissions, supplier sustainability risks, energy consumption patterns, and regulatory benchmarks to support a company's long-term transition toward **Net Zero by 2050**.  
The project includes complete data cleaning, merging, pivot analysis, and a fully interactive Excel dashboard.

---

## 📁 **Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to evaluate:
- Facility-level GHG emissions  
- Energy consumption efficiency  
- Supplier carbon footprint impact (Scope 3)  
- Regulatory compliance against benchmarks  
- Multi-year emission trends  

The final output includes a professional dashboard and a written report with strategic recommendations.

## 📊 **Key Components**

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent formats  
- Standardized facility and supplier identifiers  
- Cleaned supplier income-distribution dictionary  
- Merged emissions, operations, supplier, and benchmark datasets using Power Query  

### **2. Analysis Performed**
- Emissions by facility, scope, and gas type  
- Energy consumption vs production efficiency  
- Supplier-wise carbon footprint risk  
- Benchmark vs Actual facility emissions  
- Year-over-year (YoY) emission trend analysis  

### **3. Dashboard Visualizations**
The Excel dashboard includes:

- **KPI Cards**  
  - Total Emissions  
  - Average Production Efficiency  
  - Total Supplier Carbon Footprint  
  - Year-over-Year Change  

- **Charts & Pivot Tables**
  - Emissions by Facility  
  - Facility Emissions vs Regulatory Benchmarks  
  - Energy Consumption Trends  
  - Supplier Carbon Footprint Distribution  
  - Emission Scope Comparisons  
  - Year-over-Year Emissions Trend  

---

## 🎯 **Key Findings**
- Some facilities show disproportionately high CO₂ emissions.  
- Energy consumption is uneven across operations.  
- Suppliers S001–S002 contribute high indirect emissions, posing Scope 3 risks.

---

## 🧠 **Strategic Recommendations**
- Implement facility-level decarbonization plans.  
- Improve operational efficiency using energy monitoring systems.  
- Strengthen supplier ESG requirements and periodic disclosures.  
- Integrate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into procurement and product design.
